# All-about-me
My name is G.Harshavardhan.
I started my journey into coding in my Btech 1st year.
I am studying in a well reputed college AMRITA VISHWAVIDHYA PEETHAM, in AMRITAPURI campus, CSE branch.
I did not give much attention towards coding even though I am a computer science student despite having best resources and teachings
I am starting this in my 1st year semester break.
Starting with java language which is said to be most volatile and valuable because of it's toughness as many people say.
Currently I don't know what domain I want to go.
So i just started with learning FUL_STACK development decided to explore in web-development. 
But before diving into web development I wanted to learn version control system(Git and Github)
So I started learning Git and Github along with a programming language (JAVA).
